# Description #
As I experiment with Elixir (http://elixir-lang.org), I decided to take on some of my unsolved ProjectEuler questions.  Generally, these are in the format of prob#{problem_number}.exs

## Run Instructions ##

After installing elixir & erlang, you can run these scripts by running the command ```bash
elixir prob17.exs
```
